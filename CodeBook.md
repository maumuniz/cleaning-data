#Variables/Data 

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

#Transformations

-The original data containing test and train datasets were merged into one 
 unified dataset in a new created folder called "unified"
-From the X_unified.txt file, the columns containing mean and std calculations
 were extracted into a new file called fulldataset.txt
-The columns of the fulldataset.txt were renamed after the corresponding
 measurement names in the features.txt file
-The fulldataset.txt file also contains two other columns, one called 
 "subject_id", that represents the id of the subjects (1 to 30), and another 
 called "activity", that is a factor vector with the names of the activities.
-At last, a new file called groupeddataset.txt was created by calculating 
 the mean of the columns of the fulldataset.txt file and grouping them by
 subject and activity.
