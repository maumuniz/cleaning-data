Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment

This repo contains the run_analysis script that runs with the UCI HAR Dataset
to clean and create an unified dataset containing the average of the mean
and standard deviation of each measurement grouped by subject and activity.

This repo also contains the file groupeddataset.txt which contains the data generated by the run_analysis script.
